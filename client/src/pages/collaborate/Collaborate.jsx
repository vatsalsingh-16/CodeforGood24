        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The Shola Trust is a non-profit, Charitable Trust involved in human inclusive nature conservation in the 
          Nilgiri region of South India. The Sholas are a unique forest type, endemic to the southern part of the 
          western ghats, and were the inspiration for us to start this organization, hence the name.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, there is more than 2000 sq km of Lantana in India. The Shola Trust aims to not only assist in 
          the lantana removal but also create an ecosystem around it that could upskill local laborers to 
          contribute lantana products to the private sector for livelihood. 
          Lantana elephants represent the journey of the organization and the vision of the project.  While these 
          elephants don't solve the problem, The Shola trust has managed to create an ecosystem for its 
          production and enablement.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Their plan is to create an ecosystem around the use of Lantana including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Innovation around large-scale lantana removal - shred it and use it for biomass industry leveraging the indigenous communities, since the forest belongs to them.</li>
          <li>Create handiworks like elephants and other animals etc.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          They work with forest officials to identify the locations with Lantana to cut, collect, pulverize and use. 
          The tracking of all the tasks is currently manual.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Innovate to Conserve: Develop a comprehensive solution to automate the identification, removal, use 
          and monitoring of the restoration process in the Shola forests.  
          The solution should also help the organization keep up with the demand of the production of lantana 
          elephants and automate the tracking of the manufacturing process with provision for insights into the 
          optimal load management, resource allocation and performance of each unit so that the organization 
          can make informed decisions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The removal of the weed will benefit the forest ecosystem, and the removal process will hopefully be self-sustaining and continuous all year round, making it very effective in the long term.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The Shola Trust’s model is to provide the communities with as little support as possible, in the hope that they will be able to let the programme evolve and develop in a way that suits them. We do not try and play a middleman role, and encourage them to market the furniture as far as possible in local areas. ‘Growth’ is very slow and often painful in this way, but is not driven or pushed by external agents, so is more organic and self sustaining.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We are happy to provide training where ever required, and encourage other groups to in turn train others, in the hope that people’s use of Lantana will expand virally. This presentation outlines the process – Lantana Furniture and Craft.
        </p>
        
        <p>We have also recently got into making briquettes that can be used as a fuel source.</p>
        
        <h2>Advertise Lantana Artifact and Biomass</h2>
        <p>
          The Shola Trust is proud to present a range of Lantana artifacts and biomass products. Our beautifully crafted Lantana elephants and other animals showcase the creativity and skill of local artisans. By purchasing these products, you support not only the conservation of the Shola forests but also the livelihoods of local communities.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Our biomass products, made from shredded Lantana, are an eco-friendly alternative for fuel and energy. These briquettes are a testament to our commitment to sustainability and innovation.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Collaboration with NGOs</h2>
        <p>
          NGOs are invited to collaborate with The Shola Trust in our mission to conserve the Shola forests and support local communities. By partnering with us, NGOs can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assist in large-scale Lantana removal and restoration projects.</li>
          <li>Provide training and support to local artisans in crafting Lantana products.</li>
          <li>Help market Lantana artifacts and biomass products to a wider audience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, we can make a significant impact on both the environment and the lives of the people who depend on it.
